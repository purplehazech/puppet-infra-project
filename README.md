puppet-infra-project
====================

What was orignally a git based puppet workflow has since evolved into what we plan on using for building nexgen servers for [Radio RaBe](http://www.rabe.ch). The main ideas behind this are the following.

* The deploy and build process is fully automated.
* Everything is organized in a true roundtrip editable fashion.
* All code must be in the open to be considered for integration.

As of now I have a working setup that integrates github with jenkins and puppet. Since this works nicely I have begun to write up an [architecture overview](https://github.com/purplehazech/puppet-infra-project/wiki/Architecture-Overview) on the github wiki.
