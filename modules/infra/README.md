Puppet Infra - Infra Module
===========================

The infra module contains basic setup routines for the various
supported operating systems.

Subclasses
----------

### Gentoo

Gentoo is where most initial development and prototyping takes
place.

### CentOS

Unstarted as of now since i haventl fully decided on what the
right enterprisey rpm based platform will be. I also might be
worth throwing some things debian based into the mix here even
though i'm not really fond of them right now.
