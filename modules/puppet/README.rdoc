== Module: puppet

Module that takes care of managing puppet and its agents. Get used by infra to ensure that a host is properly set up
to use the puppetmaster.

  $puppet_master = true
  class {'puppet': }

Install on client.

  $puppet_server = 'puppet'
  class {'puppet': }
  
The call syntax is due to change a soon as the ldap node terminus can be replaced.
